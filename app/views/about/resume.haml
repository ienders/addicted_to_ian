  %h3 An Introduction
  %p
    Ian Enders: Man or Machine?&nbsp;Some would say a bit of both.&nbsp;You be the judge, as you watch him
    learn at an incredible rate and adapt to any situation. Willing to dig in deep and get his hands dirty
    on every aspect of a project, but also keen on solving the big picture issues and getting a project done
    on time and under budget. His patience and attention to detail have made him an ideal resource for junior
    developers as they learn to get their heads around new problems and existing architectures. His intuitive and logical
    side would seem to counteract his creative side; however, they fuse together with such harmony that it's astounding.
