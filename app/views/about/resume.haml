  %h3 An Introduction
  %p
    Ian Enders: Man or Machine?&nbsp;Some would say a bit of both.&nbsp;You be the judge, as you watch him learn at an incredible rate
    and adapt to any situation.&nbsp;He is loved and treasured by all of his past team members, often treated as the comical team
    mascot.&nbsp;Regardless of this, Ian is known to attack and solve (the right) problems creatively.&nbsp;His intuitive and logical
    side would seem to counteract his creative side; however, they fuse together with such harmony that it's astounding.
