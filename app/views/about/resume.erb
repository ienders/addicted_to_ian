    <h3 class = "underlined_header">An Introduction</h3>
    <p>Ian Enders: Man or Machine?&nbsp; Some would say a bit of both.&nbsp; You be the judge, as you watch him learn at an incredible rate
    and adapt to any situation.&nbsp; He is loved and treasured by all of his past team members, often treated as the comical team
    mascot.&nbsp; Regardless of this, Ian is known to attack and solve (the right) problems creatively.&nbsp; His intuitive and logical
    side would seem to counteract his creative side; however, they fuse together with such harmony that it's astounding.</p>
